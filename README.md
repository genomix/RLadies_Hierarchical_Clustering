# Introduction to Hierarchical Clustering

### What is Clustering?

Clustering is the process of dividing the population into a number of groups based on patterns in the data. Clusters or groups are defined such that data points within the same group are more similar to each other than to data points in other clusters / groups.

#### Categories of Clustering 

* Hard Clustering: In hard clustering, each data point either belongs to a cluster completely or not. 
* Soft Clustering: In soft clustering, instead of putting each data point into a separate cluster, a probability or likelihood of that data point to be in those clusters is assigned.
